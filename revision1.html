                    <h1>Soccer</h1>
                    <p>I have played soccer since I was four years old! I play attacking midfielder, and I love being a part of the offensive attack to score goals. Making new friends who eventually become like family is one of my favorite parts of playing the sport. Soccer also comes with the discipline of being an athelete which has translated to other aspects of my life.</p>

                    <h1>Art</h1>
                    <p>I have always looked for a creative outlet growing up. Whether it is through painting, drawing, singing, or crafting, I love being artistic. My two particular favorite creative outlets are painting and graphic design. I enjoy starting with a blank canvas and creating something interesting and unique! </p>
